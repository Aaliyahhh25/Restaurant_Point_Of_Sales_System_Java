# Restaurant_Point_Of_Sales_System_Java
This is a small project I worked on during my early years in college. It is a system that allows customers to browse, order, and pay online while allowing the restaurant or business to keep track of sales.

Used:
- Java (including GUI), mySQL (phpMyAdmin)

For Customers:
- can add or remove dish/es in their order
- view menu and the promos
- calculate the total amount of their order
- print order and receipt

For Admin:
- manage stock
- view sales report (best and least seller)


Sample Video of the System:
